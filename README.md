## üè• Symptom Checker Web App

A simple, user-friendly web application that leverages the power of the **Google Gemini API** to classify symptoms into categories such as **General**, **Emergency**, or **Mental Health**. It provides safe next-step recommendations and possible causes, all within a clean and responsive interface.

## üß† Agentic AI Summary
This project uses the Gemini model in an agent-like manner.

This modular design makes the AI act like a multi-purpose health assistant under direct user control.
